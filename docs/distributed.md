# Distributed Architecture

The distributed architecture enables the system to scale horizontally, improving fault tolerance and scalability. By distributing and processing tasks across multiple nodes, the system can better handle situations with a large number of users simultaneously online, providing stable and reliable services.

**Key Features:**

- **Horizontal Scaling**: The system can distribute data and process tasks across multiple nodes to achieve horizontal scaling, adapting to the growing user base.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Distributed architecture enhances system fault tolerance, ensuring normal operation even if a node fails.
- **Scalability**: The system can automatically add or remove nodes according to demand, meeting changing load requirements.
